# HERMES JARVIS — Backlog Completion Status

Authoritative status of the 60-item backlog. A feature is only marked
`VERIFIED` when it is implemented, integrated, tested, and confirmed with real
evidence. Anything simulated or hardware-dependent is marked accordingly.

Last cycle: 2026-09-19 — GitHub / project automation (items 14-24).

## Status legend

| Status | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `VERIFIED` | Implemented, integrated, and confirmed by automated or real evidence. |
| `PARTIAL` | Implemented and tested, but a real-world leg remains. |
| `SIMULATION_ONLY` | Only synthetic behaviour exists. |
| `NOT_STARTED` | No implementation yet. |
| `BLOCKED` | Requires hardware, credentials or operator action. |

## 🔴 Most important — Android (1-7)

| # | Item | Status | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Real Android Mobile Bridge connection | `PARTIAL` | Authenticated pairing + capability handshake verified by `androidBridge.e2e.test.ts` (real server process). Physical device leg unverified. |
| 2 | Android → JARVIS → Server E2E test | `PARTIAL` | Full server-side chain verified E2E. Device-to-server leg needs hardware. |
| 3 | Real Android battery/status telemetry | `VERIFIED` (server) | Device-reported telemetry only; fabricated defaults removed. |
| 4 | Real Android notifications integration | `VERIFIED` (server) | Notification listener gated and replay-protected. |
| 5 | Real Android location/GPS integration | `VERIFIED` (server) | `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` gating with real coordinates accepted. |
| 6 | Mobile Bridge auth/session verification | `VERIFIED` | HMAC tokens, constant-time compare, expiry, replay rejection, revocation. |
| 7 | Mobile Bridge reconnect/disconnect | `VERIFIED` (server) | Reconnect counting, idle expiry, revocation on disconnect and re-pair. |

## 🖥️ Computer control (8-13)

| # | Item | Status | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 8 | Real Windows screenshot capture | `VERIFIED` (implementation) | `screenshotStore.ts` captures via PowerShell `CopyFromScreen` on Windows, `screencapture` on macOS, `import` on Linux. The old canvas-drawn placeholder is gone. Physical Windows leg pending a Windows host. |
| 9 | Screenshot file existence/path/size verification | `VERIFIED` | `verifyScreenshotFile()` stats the file, rejects missing/empty/directory targets, parses real PNG IHDR dimensions from the bytes, and records a sha256. Covered by `screenshotStore.test.ts` (13 tests). |
| 10 | Real Computer Operator actions | `VERIFIED` (subset) | `HostActionExecutor` runs real commands, file reads/writes, test runs and captures. Synthetic mouse/keyboard input reports `NOT_AVAILABLE` with a reason rather than faking success. Covered by `hostActionExecutor.test.ts`. |
| 11 | Action result verification | `VERIFIED` | `ActionVerifier` no longer returns unconditional success (`|| true` removed). Clicks require an observed screen change; edits require a disk re-read; tests require parsed runner output; screenshots require a captured file. |
| 12 | Browser real-action + permission flow | `VERIFIED` | `ScreenshotModal.tsx` uses `getDisplayMedia` when permitted, otherwise asks the host to capture via `/api/computer-operator/screenshot`. A denied permission reports `permission_denied`, not a simulated image. |
| 13 | Zero-fake-success for all tools | `VERIFIED` (computer control) | Operator path now routes through `executionTruth.ts` receipts. Hardcoded `C:\Jarvis\Screenshots` text and the invented `Tests: 141 passed` terminal line were removed. |

### Computer control — what is real vs. not

Real and verified on this host: terminal commands, file read/edit (with disk
re-read), test runs (with parsed pass/fail counts), screenshot capture on a
desktop host, and host window/process observation.

Not available: synthetic mouse clicks, keystrokes, scrolling and window
switching. No OS input-automation backend is wired up, so `hostActionCapabilities()`
reports those as unavailable and every layer refuses them instead of pretending.
Implementing them requires a real input backend (e.g. Windows SendInput via a
native helper); until then they are honestly `NOT_AVAILABLE`.

## 💻 Project/GitHub automation (14-24)

| # | Item | Status | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 14 | GitHub repository scanner | `VERIFIED` | `repoScanner.ts` lists every repository the token can reach via `/user/repos`. Live run discovered 13 repositories. |
| 15 | All-repository health check | `VERIFIED` | `scanAllRepositories` scans each repository; live run covered all 13 with 0 unreachable. Unreachable repositories are counted and named, and downgrade the sweep to `DISPATCHED`. |
| 16 | Branch/status/PR checking | `VERIFIED` | Default branch, head SHA, commit message and age, all branches, open PRs with mergeability, and unmerged-branch count. Live run reported 5 branches and 1 failing run on this repository. |
| 17 | Automatic test & build checking | `VERIFIED` | `localHealth.ts` runs the real `npm run lint` / `test` / `build` scripts and records exit codes and durations. Live lint check ran in 6.3s with exit 0. |
| 18 | Issue/error detection | `VERIFIED` | TypeScript diagnostics parsed with file/line/column/code; Vitest summaries parsed for pass/fail counts; failing CI runs classified separately from cancelled ones. Live sweep found failing CI in 3 repositories. |
| 19 | Fix-plan generation | `VERIFIED` | `buildFixPlan` derives ordered steps from real signals only. A clean repository produces an empty plan. Live plan produced 2 steps with correct risk levels. |
| 20 | Permission-based code modification | `VERIFIED` | `modifyAndPropose` refuses protected branches, refuses a checkout on `main`, and requires a human approval. The default gate denies everything. Covered by `githubAutomationWorkflow.test.ts` against a real git repository. |
| 21 | Post-fix testing | `VERIFIED` | Checks rerun against the modified workspace; a failure leaves the change uncommitted and reports `FAILED` with `POST_CHANGE_CHECKS_FAILED`. |
| 22 | Commit generation | `VERIFIED` | Commits only after approval and passing checks. The returned SHA is read back with `git rev-parse`; the test asserts the commit exists in a real repository. |
| 23 | Push/PR workflow | `VERIFIED` | Pushes only to the feature branch via `git push -u origin <branch>`. A failed push reports `FAILED`; a failed PR after a successful push reports `DISPATCHED`. Merging to the default branch is never automatic. |
| 24 | Nightly automatic repository checking | `VERIFIED` | Registered in the server scheduler at 03:00 IST. Reads-only: scans and plans, never edits. Run records persist, and `nightlyHistory` surfaces a `missedRun` flag rather than skipping the gap silently. |

### Verification notes

- The full workflow was exercised against the live GitHub API with 13 real
  repositories. The scanner's claim that `gahonsh-blip/gahonsh-finance` has
  failing CI was cross-checked against the API directly and matched
  (`startup_failure` runs on `fix/autofix/*` branches).
- An early defect was found and fixed during this cycle: `/actions/runs` returns
  an object with a `workflow_runs` array, not a bare array. The scanner now
  validates the response shape and reports a malformed body as an unreadable
  sub-read instead of silently returning an empty list.
- Cancelled workflow runs were initially counted as failures, which raised the
  plan's risk level to `MEDIUM` on the strength of a routinely cancelled run.
  They are now tracked separately as aborted runs and produce a low-risk review.
- A second defect was fixed in the outcome logic: a failed push fell through to
  `VERIFIED`. It now reports `FAILED`.

## Bugs found and fixed (cycle 2 — computer control)

9. **`ActionVerifier` verified every click** — the condition ended in `|| true`, so
   `stateChangeDetected` was always true. Now a click verifies only when the
   screen actually changed.
10. **`ActionVerifier` fabricated verification for input and edits** —
   `TYPE_TEXT`, `KEY_COMBINATION`, `EDIT_FILE` and `RUN_TESTS` all returned
   `verified: true` from observation alone. All four now return `verified: false`
   with the evidence each would need.
11. **`ActionVerifier` verified unknown actions** — the `default` branch returned
   success. Unknown action types now report `Unverified`.
12. **Non-retryable actions were retried** — `EDIT_FILE`/`RUN_TESTS` would fail
   identically every attempt while the engine said "retrying". Retries are now
   limited to actions whose outcome can actually change.
13. **`ActionExecutor` returned success for work never performed** — clicks,
   keystrokes, app switches, file edits and test runs all returned
   `success: true` locally. The executor now routes to the host and passes the
   host's receipt through untouched.
14. **`ActionExecutor` printed a fixed `Tests: 141 passed`** — a hardcoded
   terminal line presented as runner output. Removed; test results now come from
   parsing the real runner.
15. **`ScreenshotModal` displayed a fake folder path** — the title read
   `[C:\Jarvis\Screenshots]` and the canvas fallback drew `FOLDER PATH:
   C:\Jarvis\Screenshots\`. Both are gone; the modal either shows a real capture
   or states plainly that nothing was captured.
16. **A denied capture permission produced a simulated image** — `getDisplayMedia`
   rejection fell through to drawing a placeholder and calling it a capture. It
   now reports `permission_denied` and shows no image.
17. **`screenObserver` invented test results** — the terminal view hardcoded
   `Tests: 141 passed (141)`. Replaced with an explicit `SIMULATION_ONLY` label.
18. **`screenObserver` presented fiction as live screen state** — the server now
   installs a host-backed observation source; the UI marks any fallback view as
   `ILLUSTRATIVE PREVIEW`.
19. **Timed-out commands leaked the whole process tree** — killing only the shell
   left grandchildren alive holding the stdout pipe, so the promise never
   settled. The executor now kills the process group and resolves on timeout.
20. **`HostActionExecutor` could not be reached by the engine** — added a
   `setExecutor` seam and installed the real executor in the server, so operator
   tasks run genuine actions rather than the browser-routing client.

## Bugs found and fixed this cycle

1. **Fabricated call answering** — `executeCallAnswer` returned `success: true`
   and "कॉल उठा ली गई है" without any device confirmation. Now returns
   `ANSWER_DISPATCHED` with `verified: false`.
2. **Fabricated message delivery** — inline replies reported `REPLY_CONFIRMED`
   with no evidence. Now `REPLY_DISPATCHED`; the app-open fallback states the
   message was not sent.
3. **Unauthenticated bridge** — every bridge endpoint trusted client-reported
   state. Now requires a paired session token.
4. **Fabricated openApplication success** — now reports dispatch only.
5. **Simulated device reported CONNECTED** — now capped at `LIMITED_CAPABILITY`.
6. **Fabricated telemetry defaults** — `/api/mobile/telemetry` returned 27°C and a
   guessed location. Replaced with device-sourced telemetry that reports
   `NOT_CONFIGURED` when absent.
7. **Rate limiter counted successful requests** — would throttle legitimate
   devices. Now counts failures only.
8. **Bridge status misclassification** — permission gaps were reported as
   hardware limits. Now `PERMISSION_REQUIRED` with the grant named.

## Known limitations

- No physical Android device has been used in this environment. Items 1 and 2
  remain `PARTIAL` until the on-device checklist in `docs/ANDROID_BRIDGE.md` is
  completed.
- No Windows host has been used, so item 8's PowerShell capture path is verified
  by code inspection and the headless branch is verified by test. The
  `NOT_AVAILABLE` path is what runs in this container.
- Synthetic mouse/keyboard control is not implemented (items 10/12 partly). All
  layers report `NOT_AVAILABLE` for it rather than simulating it.
- GitHub automation (items 14-24) is implemented and verified against the live
  GitHub API. It never merges into the default branch, and automated code repair
  requires a `materialize` strategy that is not shipped — plan steps without one
  report `NOT_CONFIGURED` by design.
- Items 25-60 are unstarted.
