## [Unreleased] - 2026-09-20 — Notification privacy fix

### 🛡️ Security & Truth Invariants
- **Hindi OTP notifications were not classified as sensitive**: the sensitive-content matcher's Hindi OTP pattern decoded to the garbled literal `ओटगीपीप` instead of `ओटीपी`, so the body of a Hindi OTP notification could be exposed through the mobile bridge. The matcher is corrected and the `ओटपी` variant added (`src/utils/mobileNotificationPrivacy.ts`).
- Removed a dead ternary in `exposeNotificationContent` (clarity only).

### 🧪 Automated Testing
- Added `src/tests/mobileNotificationPrivacy.test.ts` (39 tests) covering sensitivity detection, app categorisation, policy resolution, identity/hashing, content exposure and ingestion. Negative-validated: reverting the matcher fails the Hindi-OTP test.
- Full suite: 45 files / 675 tests passing; clean lint; clean build.

## [v2.4.0] - Natural Voice Assistant + Hindi Mode Upgrade

### 🎙️ Natural Voice & Multilingual Experience
- **Calm, Professional Voice Persona**: Upgraded tone to be soft, warm, respectful, and concise without robotic fillers or repetitive "Sir/सर" suffixes.
- **Hindi & Hinglish Natural Conversational Mode**: Added native Hindi (`hi-IN`) and bilingual Hinglish conversational fluency with accurate terminology preservation.
- **Dynamic Language Detection**: Auto-detection engine intelligently routes between Hindi, Hinglish, English, and 30+ regional languages.
- **Real-Time Speech Interruption**: Added instant speech interruption via voice commands ("Stop", "रुको", "Cancel", "चुप", "बस", "शांत रहो") and HUD controls.
- **Dynamic Language Selector in Settings**: Implemented interactive dropdown in `SettingsModal` bound to `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` registry with live locale switching.

### 🛡️ Security & Truth Invariants
- **Level-4 Human Authorization Voice Gateway**: Voice commands for public uploads, broadcasts, and remote changes enforce explicit human confirmation.
- **Truthful Status Inquiries**: Channel status queries return verified OAuth connection states without simulated or false claims.
- **Strict Finance Exclusions Guard**: Reinforced semantic blocking of all financial and payment commands.
- **6-Tier Permission Matrix**: Enforced user control over mobile telemetry (battery, weather, notifications, calendar, email, device health).
